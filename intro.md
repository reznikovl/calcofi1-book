### Project Introduction

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) is an organization that focuses on studying the marine environment surrounding the California coast in order to investigate the relationships between climate, fish population, and other human activities.

Our project initially focused on two separate datasets: 

1. Fish larvae catch data from CalCOFI cruises. This data is used to measure populations of various fish species.
2. Commercial fish data from multiple California fisheries. This data is used to supplement the fish larvae catch data.

In the beginning, we used these two datasets with the intention of finding a a relationship, if there are any, between fish larvae and fish being caught. As time passes, our workflow and goal has become more developed, and we have introduced new datasets into our project including:

3. Bottle & Cast - 2 datasets that work hand in hand with one another that contain records of the environmental conditions where the fish and larvae were found. Cast contains information about the cruise being sent out to collect the water samples, where Bottle contains information regarding the water quality including temperature and salinity.

Ultimately, our project's goal has grown from not only to establish whether any correlations can be drawn from the our fish larvae and fish catch datasets, but also investigate any environmental factors that may add variance to the relationship as well.

While the dataset contains information of six different fish species, this project primarily focuses on _Sardinops sagax_, or more commonly known as Pacific Sardine. We chose this because it would be too difficult and perhaps, even impossible to provide a conclusive statement for every single fish species as a whole. Every single species is unique, where a change in one factor may affect each fish differently. Thus, we chose the Pacific Sardine for two primary reasons. The first is that there is a lot of data for this type of fish, which cannot be said about the other species. More data means a more accurate result. The second ties with the origin of how CALCOFI was created. The decline of the sardine population in the 1940s sparked a lot of concern over the state of our ocean's ecosystem, thus leading to the creation of CalCOFI in 1949. It's been over 70 years since and we wanted to see whether any progress has made and showcase the story of the Pacific Sardine.
