    "# Linking the Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we concluded the initial exploration of our datasets, and finally decided that we would focus on sardines, we looked for ways to relate our datasets to each other. After all, we had such a plethora of data, that it was natural to try to get the most out of it and stop treating each dataset as an independent entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets that we felt made the most sense to combine were the larval and commercial fishery catch datasets. We felt it was natural to try to relate these because we felt that there is likely a causal relationship. We sought out a logical way to combine them that went beyond simple correlation... "

    "# Introducing Cross Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool we ended up settling on is called *cross correlation*. Cross correlation is similar to regular correlation, in the sense that it measures a relationship between two variables. However, cross correlation has the additional parameter of time. In other words, it allows one of the variables to be \"offset\" to see if there is a relationship when the times aren't perfectly allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought this would be perfect for our data - if we saw a large increase in larval abundance for a particular year, for example, we would expect to see a larger fishery catch some time later, which would result in a larger correlation for that specific year offset. Check out what we discovered by hitting the play button below!"
