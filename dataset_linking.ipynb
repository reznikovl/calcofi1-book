    "Our results showcase a the first numeric result, a pearson correlation of around .5965, which indicates a moderate positive linear correlation between sardine catch and sardine larvae. Thus from this we can infer that if there is more sardine larvae being caught in a single year, that means that there is more sardine in the ocean that could mate which in turn, lay more larvae.\n",

    "The second numeric result of .00024 is a p-value that tests whether these variables are correlated at all. The hypothesis testing is as followed with a 5% significant value: <br>\n",

    "H1 (alternate hypothesis) - There is a correlation between sardine catch and sardine larvae\n",

    "In simpler terms, if our value is below 5%, then we can safely conclude that the two variables we are testing do in fact have a linear correlation with one another.

    "\n",
    "Now what if we want to see if there is any connection between fish larvae and them growing up to be caught in the future? We can visualize this through a lagged correlation. According to [NOAA] (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-sardine#:~:text=They%20reproduce%20at%20age%201,hatch%20in%20about%203%20days), it takes about 1-2 years, depending on the factors, for the pacific sardine to mature and become able to reproduce. Thus, we can set back the catch lbs data by 1 year to account for the time it takes for the sardine larvae to reach adulthood. We chose 1 year as our parameter due to this [article] (http://calcofi.org/~calcofi/publications/calcofireports/v37/Vol_37_Butler_etal.pdf) which explains how after the first population collapse of the 1940s, most pacific sardine generally were able to reproduce at age 1, which some individuals being able to do so even earlier. Then we can plot and visualize our results as follows:"

    "### Introducing Cross Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "We sought to investigate this lagged relationship in more detail. The tool we ended up settling on is called *cross correlation*. Cross correlation is similar to regular correlation, in the sense that it measures a relationship between two variables. However, cross correlation has the additional parameter of time. In other words, it allows one of the variables to be \"offset\" to see if there is a relationship when the times aren't perfectly allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought this would be perfect for our data - if we saw a large increase in larval abundance for a particular year, for example, we would expect to see a larger fishery catch some time later, which would result in a larger correlation for that specific year offset.
