### Summary of Datasets

Below is a brief summary of all of the datasets that we used to conduct analysis for this project.

#### (1) Larvae Dataset

Contains information on, time (year),location (latitude/longitude), and the amount (in pounds) of larvae caught. The catch data is sorted by larvae species.

The dataset is very sparse, since the majority of cruises caught zero pounds of a given larvae species.


#### (2) Commercial Fishery Dataset

Contains information on time (year/month), location (latitude/longitude), amount of fish caught (pounds), and the price-per-pound of that fish in the given catch year (dollars).

Due to data privacy rules, some of the information relating to price-per-pound and pounds caught are redacted. 

#### (3) Block Grouping Dataset

(insert info about block grouping dataset here)

notes: maybe add screenshots of the dataframes or scrollable pieces of each data?
