###  Introduction

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) is an organization that focuses on studying the marine environment surrounding the California coast in order to investigate the relationships between climate, fish population, and other human activities.

Our project initially focused on two separate datasets: 

 * **Fish larvae catch data from CalCOFI cruises.** This data is used to measure populations of various fish species.

 * **Commercial fish data from multiple California fisheries.** This data is used to supplement the fish larvae catch data.

In the beginning, we explored these two datasets with the intention of finding a relationship between the amount of fish larvae detected and the amount of adult fish caught. Over time, our workflow and goal became more developed, leading us to incorporate a third dataset into our project:

 * **Bottle and Cast Data**. A dataset that contains records of the current environmental conditions surrounding the location of the fish and larvae. Cast refers to information about the cruise itself and Bottle refers to information regarding the water quality, including temperature and salinity.

Ultimately, our project's goal shifted from establishing whether any correlations can be drawn from the fish larvae and fish catch datasets to investigating any environmental factors that may add variance to the relationship as well.

While the dataset contains information of six different fish species, this project primarily focuses on _Sardinops sagax_, or more commonly known as Pacific Sardine. We chose this because it would be too difficult and perhaps, even impossible to provide a conclusive statement for every single fish species as a whole. Every single species is unique, where a change in one factor may affect each fish differently. Thus, we chose the Pacific Sardine for two primary reasons. The first is that there is a lot of data for this type of fish, which cannot be said about the other species. More data means a more accurate result. The second ties with the origin of how CALCOFI was created. The decline of the sardine population in the 1940s sparked a lot of concern over the state of our ocean's ecosystem, thus leading to the creation of CalCOFI in 1949. It's been over 70 years since and we wanted to see whether any progress has made and showcase the story of the Pacific Sardine.
